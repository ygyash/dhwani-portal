# Dhwani Ultimate portal
*A portal made for the Music Club of BIT Mesra which is used for recommending songs to a Band for performances according to their needs. It is also used for booking day to day slots of the music room. *

## Project Idea

- As a music club member, booking a slot in the music room of our college is quite a cumbersome process. In order to make the process more convenient, this portal was made.

- A song recommender is added which can be used by the bands or musical groups to get songs that suits there needs.   
 

## Tools and Technologies used
* Node.js - For the server side functioning of the portal.
* [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) - For getting the list of songs according to the options.
* [Material Dashboard Dark Edition](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-dashboard-dark/examples/dashboard.html) - For the front end.
